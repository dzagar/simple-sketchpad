SE3353 (Human-Computer Interface Design) Assignment 3
## Description
A simple Paint application, built using Paper.js.
### Instructions to run:
1. Install "Web Server for Chrome" (if you don't use Chrome... then just leave now because this instruction set is for Chrome).
2. Launch "Web Server for Chrome" and go to the button "Choose Folder" and pick the directory that contains this project's *index.html* file.
3. Below the "Choose Folder" button, there will be a list of *Web Server URL(s)*. Click the URL to view the application.
4. Have fun sketching!

##### Note
Need to eventually implement Group/Ungroup, but didn't have time.
